    <h2>Add New Face</h2>
    <p>Enter the name of the person you want to add. A folder will be created for them in the 'dataset' directory.
        You then need to manually place their face images (e.g., JPG, PNG) into that new folder
        (e.g., `dataset/John_Doe/`).</p>
    <p>After adding images, remember to click the "Train Model Now" button on the Dashboard!</p>

        <h3>Future Enhancement: Live Image Capture</h3>
        <p>In a more complete system, this page would allow you to capture images directly from the webcam for a new person.
           This feature is not implemented in this basic UI version but is highly recommended for ease of use.</p>
        <p>Example flow for live capture:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enter name and click 'Start Capture'.</li>
            <li>Webcam stream appears.</li>
            <li>System automatically captures N images of the person's face.</li>
            <li>Images are saved to `dataset/Person_Name/`.</li>
        </ol>
